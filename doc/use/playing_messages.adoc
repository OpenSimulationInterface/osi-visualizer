= Playing back messages from a trace file

OSI Visualizer can visualize the content of an OSI trace file.

**Prerequisites**

OSI Visualizer is running.

**Steps**

. In the configuration panel of the channel, select **Playback**.
. From the **ZMQ** drop-down list, select the ZMQ pattern you want to use.
. In the **Load** field, select the OSI trace file.
. From the **Data** drop-down list, select the ZMQ pattern you want to use.
. In the **Delay** field, enter the delta-delay in milliseconds.
  The delta-delay slows down the playback speed by delaying each message by the given value.
. If you want to publish the messages to localhost, select **Send to Port** and enter the port number you want to send OSI messages to.
. If you want to add a FMU, check the **FMU** box and select the appropriate FMU file.
. Once you have configured the channel correctly, press the **Play** button to start the playback. 

**Result**

The channel is playing back the OSI trace file.
If **Send to Port** is enabled, the messages are sent to localhost at the given port.

**Troubleshooting**

When playing back large trace files, the visualization may not render smoothly.
In this case, increase the delta-delay.
