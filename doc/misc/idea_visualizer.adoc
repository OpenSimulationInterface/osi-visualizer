= The idea of OSI Visualizer

OSI Visualizer is a visualization tool for OSI messages.
It provides two independent channels that can use different input sources.
OSI Visualizer either receives OSI messages via network or reads them from an OSI trace file.
If OSI Visualizer reads messages from a trace file, it can also publish them to a configured port of `localhost`.
OSI Visualizer supports `GroundTruth`, `SensorView` and `SensorData` messages.
