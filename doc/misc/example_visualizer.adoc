= Example use of OSI Visualizer

In this example, channel 1 of OSI Visualizer reads a trace file containing `SensorView` messages and publishes these messages at port 5564.
An intermediary runs at localhost using a OSMP sensor model .
The intermediary processes `SensorView` messages received at port 5564, transforms them into `SensorData` messages, and sends them to port 5563.
OSI Visualizer listens at port 5564 for `SensorData` messages and visualizes them in channel 2.

After clicking **Play** for channel 1 and 2, OSI Visualizer visualizes the communication between the two channels.
Channel 1 plays the selected OSI input file scenario and sends out the OSI message to port 5564 at the same time.
Channel 2 visualizes the received OSI messages at localhost at port 5563 showing it on the canvas.
