# NVidia Docker for osi-visualizer

The aim of this is to be able to run the osi-visualizer in docker,
providing an automated and flexible way. For downloading, installing
and setting up all necessary files and dependencies. Ideally it would
only take time to build the first docker image, after that starting
the image, i.e. running the visualizer, will be straight forward.

## General Information

The following Docker version was used:
Docker version 18.03.1-ce, build 9ee9f40

For download and installation please refer to the following link:
https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

You will also need nvidia-docker2, please refer to the following link:
https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki/Installation-(version-2.0)


## Build
### From Terminal:
- cd ${SRC_DIRECTORY}
- sh build-nvidia-docker.sh (will build the image for you)
- sh run-nvidia-docker.sh (will run the visualizer for you)

## OSI-Visualizer protobuf files
- In order to load files into osi-visualizer, you need to palce your
  .pb files in "osi_pb" (mounted as a volume to the image)

## Note:

- Currently the osi-visualizer is set up and tested to work with the
  playback option, for using other functionalities of the
  osi-visualizer like socket communication then some updates should
  probably be done to the docker file.

- If after running the image the following error appears:

  > Creating network "osi-visualizer_default" with the default driver
  > No protocol specified
  > QXcbConnection: Could not connect to display :1

  then add the follwoing command and run the image again (no need to
  build the docker image again):

  ```sudo xhost +```
